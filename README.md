# AI-Driven-Fuel-Design-Framework

This repository contains the code used in the manuscript titled:

> *"An AI-driven framework for fuel design in physicochemical property space toward sustainable engine combustion."*

The framework consists of two main modules:
1. **Conditional Expert Architecture** for prediction of engine performance based on fuel physicochemical properties.
2. **NSGA-II based Optimization** for identifying optimal fuel property combinations to improve engine performance.
